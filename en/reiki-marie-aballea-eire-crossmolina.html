        <p><mark>Rei meaning Universal </mark></p> 
          <p><mark>Ki meaning energy or life force</mark></p>
          </br>
        <p>Is a gentle yet powerful form of hands-on healing that can help to restore balance and harmony to the mind and body. Used throughout the world by people of all creeds and belief systems, Reiki is something that can benefit everyone.</p>
        <p>The energy involved in Reiki healing is the universal energy that surrounds all life. You cannot see this energy as it operates on a frequency that is too fast for the naked eye to see, yet Reiki energy flows freely through you.</p>
        <p>Reiki has proved to be of great benefit for a broad range of conditions. It is used to complement conventional therapies in hospitals across the world.</p>
        <p>Reiki Treatmentscan be given anywhere at anytime as no special equipment is needed. The practitioner is a channel which the energy is drawn through by the need or imbalance in the recipient. Neither person has to use any effortof willor concentration during this process.</p>
        <p>Reiki is for everyone from the youngest baby to the most senior “senior citizen”.</p>
        <p>Reiki has a very positive effect on all ailments and can be used veryeffectively in conjunction with other medical treatments.</p>
        <p>The method of receiving a Reiki treatment from a practitioner is a very simple process. The recipient simply lies on a Reiki table (plinth) andif they are unable to lie down the treatment can be given in a sitting position. The mainconcern is 
for the recipient to be as comfortable as possible and there is no need to remove any clothing as Reiki willpass through anything. The practitioner gentlyplaces their hands non-intrusivelyin a sequence of positions which cover theentire body. Theperson is treated rather than specific symptoms and the person giving the treatment does not diagnose or try to control what happens.</p>
        <p>A full treatment usually takes 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1½ hours.It is importantto take four treatments in a row of four days for maximum benefit.</p>

        <p>The energy knows no concept of time, or space.</p>
        <p>Reiki distance therefore allows you to be scheduled and received when you want, at the best time of your day or evening. Reiki energy is made available to the person. </p>
        <p>This is a special moment, a moment of CALM and WELLNESS. You just have to relax, close your eyes, you let go by giving you a few minutes just for you. After a first contact by phone, you tell me about your situation and your expectations regarding care.</p>
        <p>Depending on your needs, we can work on a treatment program, established over the week or the month. It is interesting to work over time.
The reiki distance will accompany you in your PROCESS. Whatever your problem,reiki will act globally on your whole body and your whole being.</p>
        <h4>Clarification on how Reiki works from a distance</h4>
        <p><img src="/images/soleil.jpg" class="imageflottante7" alt=""></p>
        <p>ENERGY goes where INTENT takes it, without the human limitations of  TIME and SPACE. It may come as a surprise, but the facts are there.</p>
        <p>The principle of distance healing is to make Reiki energy available to a person in the PAST, PRESENT or FUTURE. The energy follows the thought so Reiki will go where the intention is.</p>
        <p>We can thus work on the LIBERATION of CELLULAR MEMORIES most of the time unconscious, anchored in our body by conditioning.</p>
        <p>The energy transmitted for reiki distance is established with the symbols. Reiki symbols are sacred designs used to give and receive the energy of the universal life force. They are like an antenna to activate and receive energy. Thus, one cantransmit reiki ACROSS THE EARTH.</p>
        <p>Reiki distance can, for some people, promote letting go (faster and easier) to receive Reiki energy without mental resistance. </p>
        <p>The duration of reiki distance treatment is between 15 and 20 min. The treatments are shorter but just as effective as a traditional treatment by laying on of hands. You should know that the effectiveness of Reiki is not proportional to the duration of the treatment performed.</p>
